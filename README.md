# Walkman

An application that takes in a user input, converts it into a number, then generates a [random walk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk) using that number as a seed. The end result is a unique random walk specific to the user's input.

## ðŸ”® Future Features

Here's some features I'd like to add:

- Zoom in and out functionality on the canvas for different views
- Allow users to control the colors of both the canvas and walk points
- Allow users to combine their walks by overlapping them and marking them with separate color(s)
